# Bikesharing Project

## Overview

- For this project I displayed data from a Citibike project that took place in New York City. The goal was to utilize this data in order to create a proposal of making a similar program in Des Moines Iowa

- Tools utilized for this project
	- Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com/shared/T7JDPH539?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)
	- Microsoft Excel
	- Pandas

## Results

1) In this chart we see that around 140,000 users of the bike program use the bikes for around 5 minutes.

2) Heres the same chart but now the gender breakdown is shown.

3) This next chart breaks down the busiest hours during a 24 hour span. I found that the busiest hours are from 7-9AM and 5-7PM on Mon/Tues/Thurs/Fri. thursday shows that it has a spike during those hours as well. Then we also see that there is a general spike in usage roughly the whole day on Saturdays.

4) Here is the same breakdown but now displaying the genders.

5) Now here is the same breakdown, but it takes into account the users of the program.

6) Now here is the display of locations based on the top starting and ending locations (starting in green, ending in red). I felt this was important in showing how many different starting --> ending routes that are possible in a city, something that can be applicable when looking at Des Moines.

## Summary

- I still need to do further analysis in order to see if the bikesharing program is good for the city of Des Moines. Its understandable to wonder if its viable due to the sheer difference in population of the two cities. I believe that there is a large enough demand for a program like this despite the population difference. With Des Moines you can leverage more places to bike (such as nature and suburban routes), with NYC all you could do is downtown routes. Something that I would look into for further reasearch is population densities in Des Moines so that you could make decision into where you want to put the intial bike areas.
